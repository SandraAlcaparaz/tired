				<p> The 50s diner originally opened in the early 1950's where it took it's famous name. The secret recipes were passed on to their family name until today.
				The owners of this diner today kept the tradition and originality of their infrustructure and menu. They did not change
				any of the styles, decorations and recipes of their diner and their food because they wanted to keep their tradition and culture
				alive. With it's vintage and retro style, the customers of today's generation are sureley euphoric about the
				ambiance of the diner. Plus, the food that we serve give them a taste back from the past but we guarantee that even though we serve retro diner
				style food, we still create new styles on our dishes that will make you fall in love to the past and the future.</p>
